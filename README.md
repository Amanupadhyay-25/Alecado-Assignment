# Alecado-Assignment
Here my task is to create a project using javascript. And in this project I have to move a object in the 3D space.
->This project is a simple 3D scene created using the Three.js library, designed to demonstrate basic 3D rendering and object movement.
> Scene Setup: Initializes a 3D scene with a camera, renderer, and lighting.
> Room and Object: Constructs a wireframe room and a movable 3D box in the center.
> User Interaction: Allows user control of the 3D box using the W, A, S, and D keys for movement.
> Responsive Design: Adjusts the renderer and camera settings dynamically on window resize.
